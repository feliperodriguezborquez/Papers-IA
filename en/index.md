### Language Models are Few-Shot Learners (GPT-3)
- **Authors:** Tom B. Brown, et al.
- **Year:** 2020
- **Publication:** [arXiv:2005.14165](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165)
- **Quick Summary:** Took LLMs to an unprecedented scale (175 billion parameters). It introduced the concept of "in-context learning" or *few-shot* learning, where the model can learn to perform a task just by seeing a few examples in the prompt.
